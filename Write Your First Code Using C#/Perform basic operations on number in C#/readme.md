# Perform basic operations on number in C\#

## Introduction

The applications you'll build in C# will require that you operate on literal and
variable numeric data. Examples might include:

- Performing simple mathematical operations including addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division
- Performing multi-step operations that must be completed in a certain order
- Determining the remainder after performing division
- Incrementing or decrementing a value, and so on

Suppose you want to perform a calculation that converts a value from one unit of
measure to another. For example, what if you needed to convert the current
temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius? Once you've calculated the temperature
in degrees Celsius, you need to display that information in a formatted message
to the user. To accomplish this, you'll need to learn to use operators to act on
operands like literal and variable values.

### Learning objectives

- Perform basic mathematical operations on numeric data
- Observe implicit type conversion when performing mathematical operations
- Temporarily convert one data type into another
